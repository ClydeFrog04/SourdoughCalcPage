# Sourdough Calculator

## What is this project?
I LOVE baking and bread making! The first step to making a good sourdough, or any bread, is figuring out what your recipe needs to be. Recipes have to be created
and modified depending on the environment on a given day. A winter sourdough dough is not a summer dough. A coastal sourdough is not the same as a dessert sourdough.
Because of this, I wanted to create a simple application that I can use as my first step in every loaf I make. There are a few basic inputs and a recipe is output at the end.
You are able to enter your flour quantity and what percentages you want to use and a recipe will be generated with those numbers.

- A future feature I hope to add is the ability for my app to query local weather conditions and make suggestions based on those conditions!
